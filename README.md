# dynamic_stream
## Inspiration: 
Our team was excited to brainstorm ideas for an educational mini game, but couldn't decide on a topic. As soon as we saw the updated list of judging categories, though, and being the mature, professional adults that we are, we knew our weekend would simply not be complete until we could tell everyone we had competed for a bidet!

## What it does: 
Dynamic Streams is a quaint little game about physics and water fountains. The player is in control of... ahem... a stream... and must try to hit the target lily pad floating on the water. The player does this by entering an angle and a velocity, clicking "Go!", and sees just how good (or bad) their aim is. If it's a hit, they score points. But if it's a miss, they'll lose a roll from their toilet paper six-pack. That stuff is precious now! Try not to run out!

## How we built it:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript w/ jQuery
HTML5
Project planning
KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
1 background in physics
Bad puns and wordplay
We knew we were going to be using JS, and that each of us would either be rusty or fairly new to it. Therefore, we focused on breaking down what tasks and milestones we wanted, starting with the bare minimum that would still be presentable, and just had fun with it. We continued researching and improving components as each milestone was reached.

## Challenges we ran into:
Calculating physics math in JS
Taking too long to realize that "fucntion" is not how to spell "function"
Relearning HTML5 canvas after 7 years
Accomplishments that we're proud of
Calculating physics math in JS
Teamwork makes the dream work
What we learned
Calculating physics math in JS
The basics for possible HTML5 game development in future
What's next for Dynamic Stream
More visual feedback for successes, misses, and the stream
Randomized target location
Varied difficulty levels
Hype for combos, tier levels for X-number of points scored
